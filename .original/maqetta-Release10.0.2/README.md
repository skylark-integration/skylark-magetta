Maqetta
=======

Maqetta provides WYSIWYG authoring of HTML5 user interfaces using drag/drop assembly. Maqetta supports both desktop and mobile user interfaces. The Maqetta application itself is authored in HTML5/Ajax, and therefore runs in the browser without requiring additional plugins or downloads. 

Features
========

* a WYSIWYG visual page editor for drawing out user interfaces
* drag/drop mobile UI authoring within an exact-dimension device silhouette, such as the silhouette of an iPhone
* simultaneous editing in either design or source views
* deep support for CSS styling (the applications includes a full CSS parser/modeler)
* a mechanism for organizing a UI prototype into a series of "application states" (aka "screens" or "panels") which allows a UI design to define interactivity without programming
* a web-based review and commenting feature where the author can submit a live UI mockup for review by his team members
* a "wireframing" feature that allows UI designers to create UI proposals that have a hand-drawn look
* a theme editor for customizing the visual styling of a collection of widgets
* export options that allow for smooth hand-off of the UI mockups into leading developer tools such as Eclipse
* Maqetta's code base has a toolkit-independent architecture that allows for plugging in arbitrary widget libraries and CSS themes
