<h2>Preview 3 release notes</h2>

<p>The Preview 3 release includes the following updates:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
	<li><strong>Mobile authoring updates</strong>. 
		The Preview 3 release builds on the Preview 2 release (which introduced extensive
		support for the comprehensive Dojo Mobile 1.7 widget library, including automatic
		theme switching to deliver native look-and-feel for iPhone, Android and Blackberry
		devices) by providing improved handling of View widgets (View, ScrollableView and SwapView),
		along with 
		<a href="https://github.com/maqetta/maqetta/issues?labels=Mobile&sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1&milestone=14" target="_blank">some key mobile authoring bug fixes</a>.
		Whereas in Preview 2, authors needed to carefully manage View widget visibility by manual
		efforts to ensure only one View widget eyeball icon was active, with Preview 3, Maqetta
		now automatically mimics Dojo Mobile's runtime behavior and ensures that exactly one 
		View widget (among a set of sibling View widgets) is visibla at any given time.
		To switch from authoring within one View to authoring a different View, the author
		simply has to click on the alternate View in the Outline palette, either by clicking
		on the View's row in the Outline palette or the View's eyeball icon. (The mobile tutorial has been updated
		to reflect these new features.)
	</li>
	<li><strong>Multiple project support</strong>. 
		Maqetta Preview 3 adds support for multiple projects, primarily by the addition of the
		a <strong>New Project...</strong> command on the main toolbar, along with the ability to 
		switch the currently active project via a drop-down menu at the top of the Files palette.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Eclipse-compatible projects</strong>. 
		The <strong>New Project...</strong> dialog contains an "Eclipse support" checkbox,
		which if checked, will result in the new project having a file hierarchy that
		matches the file hierarchy (and hidden configuration files) that the Eclipse IDE 
		creates by default when creating a web project. This option also creates
		the appropriate configuration files used by IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD)
		when creating a web project that includes the Dojo toolkit facet. This "Eclipse support"
		option allows a designer to export his Maqetta project as a ZIP (via one of the download icons
		on the Files palette) and then hand off to a developer who can import the project into Eclipse and/or RAD
		for further development. (The export to Eclipse tutorial has been updated
		to reflect these new features.)
	</li>
	<li><strong>Bug fixes with nested folders</strong>. 
		Along with the new "project" features, the Preview 3 release also include several
		key bug fixes around saving files within nested folders.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic grid lines and snapping for absolute-positioned widgets</strong>. 
		When using absolute positioning, Maqetta now shows dynamic grid lines as you drag out a 
		new widget or move an existing widget via drag/drop. The dynamic grid lines
		show prospective alignment points with the left/center/right and top/middle/bottom
		for other existing widgets. This makes it quick and easy in absolute positioning
		mode to align widgets with other widgets (e.g., center align a text label with its corresponding text box).
	</li>
	<li><strong>DataGrid can now read in data from a remote URL, including URLs from other domains</strong>. 
		With Preview 2, DataGrid accepted either user-entered dummy data in the form
		of multiple rows of comma-separated information, or data from a
		JSON file from the user's workspace.
		With Preview 3, Maqetta now supports JSON data from remote URLs,
		including URLs that come from a different domain (using JSONP under the hood).
	</li>
	<li><strong>Support for several new Dojo widgets</strong>. 
		This release adds support for the following Dojo/Dijit widgets:
		<ul>
			<li>dijit.Form</li>
			<li>dijit.ColorPalette</li>
			<li>dijit.form.ComboButton</li>
			<li>dijit.form.CurrentTextBox</li>
			<li>dijit.form.NumberSpinner</li>
			<li>dijit.form.NumberTextBox</li>
			<li>dijit.form.TimeSpinner</li>
			<li>dijit.form.ToggleButton</li>
			<li>dijit.form.ValidationTextBox</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>New Theme command now opens theme editor</strong>. 
		In previous releases, to create a new theme and then edit that theme, the user
		need to issue two separate commands, first New Theme and then Open Theme.
		With Preview 3, the New Theme command automatically opens the theme editor
		on the new theme that the user has just created.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Several user interface fixes for Web-based review and commenting</strong>. 
		This release includes 
		a number of bug fixes and UI improvements
		in the review and commenting feature, including improved approaches
		to showing annonations that correspond to a particular comment
		versus annotations associated with other comments.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Fixes for some caching bugs</strong>. 
		The Preview 3 release includes a couple of caching bug fixes that were in previous
		releases where the author had to hit refresh (and/or clear browser cache and then refresh).
		(Unfortunately, not all caching bugs have been addressed yet.
		Subsequent releases will address the issues found 
		<a href="https://github.com/maqetta/maqetta/wiki/Caching" target="_blank">
		on this wiki page
		</a>
		).
	</li>
	<li><strong>Code is now fully globalized</strong>. 
		The Maqetta team went through the entire project and replaced all hard-coded strings
		with dynamic references to a localization bundle, thereby making it possible
		to localize Maqetta simply by adding alternate localization files.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Mac Safari 5.1 now required</strong>. 
		The Preview 3 release requires Safari 5.1. There is a critical bug fix
		in Safari 5.1 needed by Maqetta.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Many other bug fixes</strong>. 
		Preview 3 includes over 150+ miscellaneous bug fixes. Some of those fixes
		can be seen by going to 
		<a href="https://github.com/maqetta/maqetta/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1&milestone=14" target="_blank">
		this URL which lists bugs closed against the Preview 3 release</a>.
