<h1>Maqetta 8 Release Notes</h1>

<p>The Maqetta 8 release includes the following updates:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Widget Palette Makeover</span> - 
		The Widget Palette (the "Palette") at the top left of Maqetta's visual page designer has been redesigned with Release 8. Some highlights:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Folders and subfolders</span> - 
				The Widget Palette now supports two levels of widget groupings - top level folders
				(e.g., Containers, Controls, Clip Art), and some folders have subfolders.
				For example, the Controls folder has various subfolders (e.g., Butttons, Sliders/Spinners, TextBoxes, etc).
				This solves a problem with previous Maqetta releases where some of the 
				sections of the Widget Palette had as many as 50 different widgets within the section,
				which made it difficult to find the widget you needed for a particular task.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Large-size widget icons</span> - 
				With Release 8, the Widget Palette includes newly designed, large-size widget icons (50x50),
				arranged left-to-right, top-to-bottom within a particular section of the widget palette.
				The larger size icons allow greater graphical hints about the given widget's capabilities.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Different list of "suggested widgets" for different composition types 
				(mobile, desktop, sketch)</span> - 
				With previous releases, the same set of widgets appeared for all composition types
				(mobile, desktop, or sketch), with the desktop widgets listed at the top. 
				This older one-size-fits-all widget list made it difficult for mobile developers
				to find the mobile widgets they needed, and made it difficult for users who
				wanted to do quick sketching to find the Drawing Tools and Clip Art widgets.
				With Release 8, when you choose a particular
				composition type from the Create menu (e.g., mobile application vs sketch hi-fidelity),
				the Widget Palette will now show a list of categories and widgets that are appropriate
				to the composition type you have chosen. For example, for mobile applications,
				the topmost sections show the mobile widgets that users most commonly use when building
				mobile applications. Similarly, for desktop applications, the topmost sections show the desktop
				widgets that users typically use for desktop applications. For sketching, the topmost sections
				are Drawing Tools and Clip Art.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Redundant/overlapping widgets collapsed into a single icon</span> - 
				Previously, if different widget libraries (e.g., Dojo desktop, Dojo mobile, HTML) provided similar
				widgets (e.g., each of these libraries provides a "Button" widget), the Maqetta widget palette
				would show each variation of that widget as a separate choice in the palette. 
				With Release 8, the variations are all collapsed
				into a single widget icon (e.g., a "Button" widget). If a given widget icon represents
				multiple alternate widgets, the widget icon will show a gray circle with a caret symbol at the
				top-right. The user can click on the caret symbol to bring up a popup which allows him 
				to switch to one of alternate widgets instead of the default choice for that particular widget category.
				For example, for desktop applications, the default "Button" is the Dojo desktop button widget 
				(from the Dijit library), and one of the alternates is the HTML button widget.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Help information and tooltip for each widget</span> - 
				Each widget icon in the Widget Palette contains a small gray ? icon at its lower right.
				Clicking on the ? icon will bring up a popup that displays explanatory information
				about the widget, usually a summary and sometimes a longer description.
				Each widget also has a hover tooltip that displays when you hover the mouse
				over the widget icon. The hover tooltip displays the widget's name and 
				the widget library which defines this particular widget. If the given widget icon
				represents more than one underlying widget (for example, a Dojo button and an HTML button),
				then the hover tooltip lists the alternate versions.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Suggested widgets versus All widgets</span> - 
				The new Widget Palette has a dropdown menu at the top right (next to the filter field)
				which has two options: "Suggested widgets" (the default) and "All widgets".
				With Suggested widgets, Maqetta only shows widgets that apply to the current composition
				type. For example, if the current file is a mobile application, the suggested widgets
				will include all of the mobile widgets from Dojo and exclude the desktop widgets.
				(Vice versa for desktop applications). If you are developing a mobile application and
				want to use a desktop widget, then choose "All widgets" and the palette will reconstitute
				itself to show both mobile and desktop widgets (along with HTML, Drawing Tools and Clip Art).
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Site-specific configuration options</span> - 
		Release 8 includes customization hooks that enable specific installations to 
		customize aspects of the Maqetta user interface. The customizations are defined
		by JSON files that can be included in the siteConfig/ folder for a particular installation.
		Configuration options allow command-line definition of the location of the siteConfig/ folder</p>
		<p>This release includes support for the following two configuration options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Default CSS themes (desktop and mobile)</span> - 
				The defaultTheme.json file in the siteConfig/ folder specifies the default
				themes for desktop applications and each of the different mobile platforms
				supported by Dojo 1.8 (Android, Blackberry, iPad, iPhone and custom/other).
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Widget Palette</span> - 
				The widgetPalette.json file in the siteConfig/ folder specifies the various
				sections and subsections in the Widget Palette, and which widgets should be
				included in which section.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Other</span> - </p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Update to Dojo 1.8.1</span> - 
				Release 8 now ships with Dojo 1.8.1.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Mobile previews now show direct URL</span> - 
				A new field has been added to the mobile previewer which shows the direct URL
				for the mobile application that is showing in the previewer. 
				You can then type this direct URL into your mobile device to run your
				application on the given device.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Fixes for Surround with when in sketch mode</span> - 
				In previous releases, if you were in sketch mode (i.e., absolute positioning),
				and you selected one or more widgets, and then issued a "Surround with" command
				(Surround with &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt; or &lt;a&gt;), the new container element
				ended up at the top/left of the canvas. With Release 8, the new container element
				is correctly sized and positioned to exactly surround the widgets that had been selected.
				Also, the selection changes at the end of the operation such that the new
				container element is selected.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Bug fixes</span> - 
				Release 8 includes 150+ bug fixes. Some of those fixes
				can be seen by going to 
				<a href="https://github.com/maqetta/maqetta/issues?labels=&milestone=17&page=1&state=closed" target="_blank">
				this URL which lists bugs closed against Release 8</a>.
