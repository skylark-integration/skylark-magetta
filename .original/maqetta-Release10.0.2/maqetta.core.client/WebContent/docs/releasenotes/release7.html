<h1>Maqetta 7 Release Notes</h1>

<p>The Maqetta 7 release includes the following updates:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>User Interface Makeover</span> - 
		The Maqetta user interface has had a major makeover with Release 7, with countless UI tweaks. Some highlights:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Graphics redesign</span> - 
				With Release, 7, nearly all of the major user interface components have new visual styling.
				There is new visual styling on the topmost banner (and its icons and menus), the file tabs,
				the toolbar, and the various palettes on the left and right side of the application.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Redesigned, collapsable palettes on left and right side of user interface</span> - 
				Release 7 provides redesigned palettes on the left and right side of the application.
				The palettes can be collapsed easily to maximize the size of the editing canvas.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Streamlined user interface for creating HTML files</span> - 
				Previously, to create a new HTML file, we presented a dialog where you had to pick
				a composition type (e.g., desktop hi-fi page vs desktop lo-fi sketch).
				With Release 7, the Create menu now includes an easier-to-understand list of
				common user operations (Mobile Application, Desktop Application, Sketch, etc.), 
				and users can start editing new documents faster.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Redesigned and streamlined toolbar</span> - 
				The toolbar has been redesigned so that common operations can be discovered
				and used more quickly. Whereas in previous releases, some commands were only
				available on the page editor's context menu, with Release 7 all page editor
				commands also are available from the toolbar.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>New welcome page</span> - 
				Release 7 includes a newly designed welcome page, with buttons at the top
				for common "New" actions (e.g., New Mobile Application), and buttons at the bottom
				for getting started information (e.g., tutorials and videos).
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>New login and registration screens</span>  - Login and registration screens have 
				similar visual styling to the main Maqetta application.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Performance improvements</span> - 
		Release 7 includes performance improvements in several areas. In particular:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Page editor speedups</span> - 
				Release 7 includes several performance improvements, 
				particularly around opening HTML files and increased snappiness
				when users add new widgets to the page. Under the hood, among the key changes
				were changing synchronous web requests to asynchronous and using optimized versions
				of widget JavaScript files.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Outline palette speedups</span> - 
				The underlying code for the Outline palette has been rewritten, 
				resulting in considerably fewer full redraws of that palette as the document changes.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Zazl option to improve performance with preview-in-browser</span> - 
				Release 7 integrates the
				<a href='http://www.zazl.org/' title='Zazl project page'>Zazl</a>
				open source technology into Maqetta's preview-in-browser feature. When enabled,
				whenever a user clicks on the preview-in-browser button, Maqetta will run the
				Zazl Optimizer on the server to optimize (concatenate and minify) Javascript
				on the user's HTML page on demand. This will minimize network requests and download sizes 
				when viewing that page directly in the web browser, improving performance, particularly on network
				connections with high latency. Zazl does take some elapsed time to perform this task,
				but results are cached and shared, so subsequent page loads should be even faster for a given set of widgets.
				With Release 7, Zazl is an experimental feature which must be enabled in the Preferences Dialog
				on the Settings menu at the top-right of the top toolbar.  It does not yet work with all Maqetta features
				such as JSONP data or custom widgets. The goal is to enable Zazl by default in an upcoming release.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Eclipse Orion integration</span> - 
		Mostly under the hood, Release 7 includes major changes to more completely integrate
		Maqetta with the <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/orion/' target="_blank">Eclipse Orion open source project</a>.
		Most users won't notice these changes, but nevertheless they represent some of the
		most significant Release 7 code changes. Some notes on these changes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>"Open Orion Navigator"</span> - 
				Release 7 adds a new command to the Open menu, "Open Orion Navigator", which
				opens a new browser window that launches the Eclipse Orion cloud-based source development tools,
				where you can perform source editing in the cloud on the various files within your Maqetta workspace.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Back-end changes to use Orion for user and workspace management</span> - 
				With Release 7, we have replaced most of the old logic for user management and workspace management
				with Orion code that provided similar services. These back-end changes improve the robustness
				and completeness of the Maqetta server, provides additional functionality, and
				improves long-term maintenance and code sharing between the Maqetta and Eclipse Orion projects. 
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Long-term strategic benefits</span> - 
				The Eclipse Orion team has implemented (or is pursuring for future releases)
				several features that will benefit Maqetta users. By using Eclipse Orion code for Maqetta's
				user management and workspace management, Maqetta users will get many features
				"for free" as future versions of Maqetta upgrade to future releases of Orion.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>HTML table enhancements</span> - 
		With Release 7, we have added multiple user interface improvements
		around using HTML tables. HTML tables can be highly useful not only
		to display information in a tabular format, but also is one option for
		achieving tabular layout of user interface components, such as name/address forms
		which have labels on the left and text fields on the right.
		HTML table enhancements include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Table dialog at table creation time (and subsequent editing)</span> - 
				With Release 7, when a user adds an HTML table to the page, 
				he is presented with a dialog that allows the user to chooose the following options:
				<ul>
					<li>Number of rows</li>
					<li>Number of columns</li>
					<li>Border thickness (0 means no border)</li>
					<li>'border-collapse' property value (default is 'collapse')</li>
					<li>'table-layout' property value (default is 'fixed')</li>
					<li>Checkbox for whether first row should be a header row (i.e., use TH elements instead of TD elements)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Column operations</span> - 
				Users can select a table column either by selecting a table cell and then issuing
				the "Select column" command (found on the "Table commands" icon on the toolbar and
				on the context menu). When a column is selected, the user can:
				<ul>
					<li>Set the 'width' property or background properties in the Properties palette.
						Under the hood, in the HTML source code that corresponds to the table,
						these CSS properties will be attached to the <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> element
						corresponding to the given column.</li>
					<li>Users can change column widths by interactively pulling on the blue circular nobs that appear on the left and right
						side of the selection chrome when a table column is selected.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Tree widget enhancements</span> - 
		With Release 7, we have greatly enhanced the dialog that appears when
		creating or editing a Tree widget. This dialog allows users to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify custom icons on individual tree nodes. 
				For container tree nodes, users can specify both a closed and open icon.</li>
			<li>Actions to take for each of these events:
				<ul>
					<li>click</li>
					<li>double-click</li>
					<li>open</li>
					<li>close</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Ability to reorder tree nodes via simple drag/drop.</li>
			<li>Use toolbar buttons to insert new tree nodes, remove tree nodes, move tree nodes up and down in the list, 
				and control indentation levels on particular tree nodes.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Upgrade to Dojo 1.8, more mobile widgets</span> - 
		Release 7 supports the latest release of Dojo (version 1.8) and includes
		support for a number of new Dojo Mobile widgets. New mobile widgets include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Slider</li>
			<li>SearchBox</li>
			<li>ContentPane</li>
			<li>Container</li>
			<li>Pane</li>
			<li>ScrollablePane</li>
			<li>Accordion</li>
			<li>GridLayout</li>
			<li>IconMenu</li>
			<li>IconMenuItem</li>
			<li>ProgressIndicator</li>
			<li>DataCarousel</li>
			<li>DataCarousel</li>
			<li>ValuePicker</li>
			<li>ValuePickerSlot</li>
			<li>ValuePickerDatePicker</li>
			<li>ValuePickerTimePicker</li>
			<li>DatePicker</li>
			<li>TimePicker</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Save As Widget</span> - 
		With Release 7, we have added a "Save As Widget" command on the dropdown menu next to the Save button
		on the toolbar. This command will create a re-usable widget out of the currently selected widget,
		and add a new widget into a "User Widgets" section of the widgets palette. This feature allows
		a Maqetta user to create custom re-usable components that he needs to use in multiple places
		within his user interfaces.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Enhancements and improvements to applications states feature</span> - 
		Release 7 includes many fixes and improvements to the applications states feature:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Application states can be used with mobile UIs</span> - 
				In previous releases, application states were designed to only work
				with desktop user interfaces. In fact, the Maqetta user interface tried to hide the
				application states feature when device silhouettes were visible. 
				Now with Release 7,
				it is possible to use applications states with mobile UIs.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Ability to change the name of an application state</span> - 
				The Scenes palette includes a 3rd "modify state" icon that allows 
				you to change the name of an application state.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Ability to choose an initial state</span> - 
				In previous releases, when running
				your application (e.g., preview in browser), the page always began in the "Normal" state.
				With Release 7, the "modify state" icon (see previous bullet) brings up a dialog
				that includes a checkbox that allows the Maqetta user to say that a particular
				state should be the initial state at runtime for his application.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Shortcut keys for common operations</span> - 
		We have implemented some short-cut keys for common operations. Here is a partial list 
				(refer to the documentation for an updated and complete list):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ctrl-z: undo (Cmd-z on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-Shift-z: redo (Cmd-Shift-z on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-x: cut (Cmd-x on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-c: copy (Cmd-c on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-v: paste (Cmd-v on Mac)</li>
			<li>DEL or BS: delete</li>
			<li>Ctrl-s: save (Cmd-s on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-Shift-s: saveAs (Cmd-Shift-s on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-o: open file (Cmd-o on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-0: preview in browser (Cmd-0 on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-1: design view (Cmd-1 on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-2: source view (Cmd-3 on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-3: split vertically view (Cmd-3 on Mac)</li>
			<li>Ctrl-4: split horizontally view (Cmd-4 on Mac)</li>
			<li>F1: open new window showing Maqetta documentation</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Revamped online documentation</span> - 
		The documentation set has been reorganized and streamlined. 
		In particular, Release 7 includes a set of "cheat sheets"
		(interactive quick reference guides) focused on various aspects of the Maqetta user interface.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Other</span> - </p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Ability to control which mobile views appear at page startup</span> - 
				For Dojo mobile view widgets, the 'selected' property under the "Widget" section can be 
				checked or unchecked to control which view widget is visible initially when the 
				your mobile application first comes up.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>No longer using port 55556</span> - 
				We integrated NGINX into the Maqetta server, which allowed us to run the Maqetta application
				on port 80 at http://app.maqetta.org/maqetta (vs http://maqetta.org:55556/maqetta). 
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Removal of experimental (untested) widgets</span> - 
				Previous releases included experimental, partial support for various widgets
				under the widget categories "Untested Dojo &amp; HTML", jQuery and YUI. With Release 7,
				the product only includes supported widgets and no longer shows any of the experimental
				or proof-of-concept widgets. We have plans to include full support for many of the 
				experimental widgets in future releases. 
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Allows dojox.mvc in HTML source code</span> - 
				dojox.mvc is a package of technology in Dojo 1.8 that allows bi-directional
				data binding between a client-side JSON store and widgets on the page.
				While Release 7 does not offer visual authoring support for dojox.mvc
				(Dojo 1.8 data binding), our testing indicates that users can enter dojox.mvc
				markup into their Maqetta pages while using the Maqetta page editor
				to build their user interface.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Various widget selection bugs fixed</span> - 
				In previous releases, when the currently selected widget was at the edge of the page,
				the widget selection box around the widget would be pulled into the user page, 
				with the result that the widget selection box was not accurate. With Release 7,
				selection logic has been rewritten and this problem no longer exists.
				Also, there were several fixes around selection boxes being in the wrong place
				when the page or container widgets were scrolled.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>GridX upgrade</span> - 
				Support for <a href="http://oria.github.com/gridx/" target="_blank">GridX</a> was introduced in Release 6 with an early version of the 
				GridX code base. For Release 7, we have upgraded to GridX 1.0.
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Many bug fixes</span> - 
				Release 7 includes 750+ bug fixes. Some of those fixes
				can be seen by going to 
				<a href="https://github.com/maqetta/maqetta/issues?milestone=16&page=1&state=closed" target="_blank">
				this URL which lists bugs closed against Release 7</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Migration of User Workspaces</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Migration Process</span> -
		This release changes how files are constructed and stored in users' workspaces.  Migration is a two step process:

		<ol>
			<li>
				Run the <a href="https://raw.github.com/maqetta/maqetta/master/migration/m6-m7-migrate.sh" target="_blank">m6-m7-migrate.sh</a> script within a copy of the 'users' directory.  This will update users' files to better work with this release.
			</li>
			<li>
				Set the <code>migrateWorkspaceLoc</code> property to point to the migrated 'users' directory.  Set this in the <em>maqetta.conf</em> configuration file, in the top level of the release folder.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p><em>Note:</em> The migration script only works on Unix-based systems.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Widgets</span> - </p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>HTML tables and empty cells</span> - 
				If you were working with HTML tables in earlier releases of Maqetta, you will likely notice that when you open those pages using Maqetta 7 
				that empty cells will have a height of 0 in the page editor. It is recommended that you use the source editor to add <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> to all 
				of your empty table cells (e.g, the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements) to workaround this issue. Any new HTML tables created by Maqetta will 
				automatically have their empty cells filled with the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> character, so this will be a one time change.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
