<h1>Maqetta 9 Release Notes</h1>

<p>The Maqetta 9 release includes the following updates:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Several new tutorials</span> - 
		Release 9 now several new tutorials. The learning materials
		for Maqetta are now reasonably comprehensive.
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>LDAP integration option</span> - 
		Release 9 provides hooks so that intranet installations of Maqetta can integrate
		with a company's LDAP-based user authentication system. Site administrators
		who wish to integrate their custom deployment of Maqetta with their LDAP
		should customize the <code>maqetta.conf</code>
		file within the Maqetta distribution and search for the "LDAP" options in that file.
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>WAR file so Maqetta can be deployed on Tomcat</span> - 
		Release 9 now includes a WAR version of Maqetta so that Maqetta can be integrated
		with application servers such as Tomcat.
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Application States enhancements in Scenes Palette</span> - 
		Release 9 adds three new icons to the Scenes palette which provide additional
		productivity features when working with Maqetta's application states feature:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Manage widget visibility icon</span> 
				<img src='img/ManageWidgetVisibility.gif' style='vertical-align:middle; margin:0px 3px;'/> - 
				(Active only when there is at least one selected widget)
				This icon brings up the Manage Widget Visibility dialog, which
				allows you to see at a glance in which application states the current selected
				widgets are visible, and allows you to change the visibility of the given widgets
				in each of the application states. Additional notes:
				<ul>
					<li>The dialog will indicate (via a text note) whether
						widgets that are visible within a particular custom state are the result of
						being visible in the Background state and therefore "shining through" to the
						given custom state. </li>
					<li>The dialog includes a "Background only" button which will push all selected
						widgets to the Background so that they will be visible in all states.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>New widgets to current state toggle icon</span> 
				<img src='img/GoBackground.gif' style='vertical-align:middle; margin:0px 3px;'/>
				<img src='img/GoCurrent.gif' style='vertical-align:middle; margin:0px 3px;'/> - 
				This toggle icon controls whether new widgets will be added to the Background state
				(and therefore will "shine through" and be visible in all application states)
				or will be added to the current application state (assuming Background is not
				the current state). The first time you run Maqetta, the icon is initialized
				to Background state. When you change this icon, that value will be in place
				until you change it again (including across sessions).
				<div class='note'>NOTE: Be careful monitoring the current value of this icon
				so that new widgets get added to the state(s) in which you want those widgets
				to be visible.)</div>
			</li>
			<li><span class='minortopic'>Highlight background wigets</span> 
				<img src='img/HighlightBackgroundDis.gif' style='vertical-align:middle; margin:0px 3px;'/>
				<img src='img/HighlightBackground.gif' style='vertical-align:middle; margin:0px 3px;'/> - 
				(Effect of this toggle icon is visible only when a custom application state is active)
				This toggle icon controls whether to highlight widgets that are visible in the Background state
				and therefore "shine through" and are therefore also visible in the current application state.
				Widgets that are shining through from the Background will be highlighted with
				a light red border and light red interior.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Rectangles and Circle widgets can now contain child content</span> - 
		In previous releases, the Rectangle, RoundedRectangle and Circle widgets (found in the "Drawing Tools"
		section of the widget palette) were primitive widgets, and therefore could not contain
		child widgets. With Release 9, those three widgets now act as containers.
		Now, if you add a Rectangle (or RoundedRect or Circle) to the canvas,
		and then add other widgets such that the drop point for the new widgets are inside
		the bounds of the Rectangle, then those widgets will be children of the Rectangle.
		This makes sketching with Rectangles, RoundedRectangles and Circle 
		behave the same as sketching with other similar widgets (e.g., HTML <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>)
		and this nesting feature makes it more convenient to copy/paste and manage visibility
		of the container (with all of its children) rather than having to perform operations
		on many different primitive widgets.
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Events palette now includes easy drop-down for switching to different HTML page</span> - 
		In previous releases, the drop-down menu next to all of the events on the Events palette
		(onclick, ondblclick, etc) only showed the list of application states in the document.
		With Release 9, the menu has been enhanced to also show the list of HTML files in your current project.
		If you use the menu to choose one of the HTML files as the event value, then 
		at runtime the given action (e.g., onclick) will cause the browser to switch
		to the given HTML page. (Accomplished under the hood via the following JavaScript logic:
		<code>location.href='&lt;newhtmlefilename&gt;';</code>.
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>States operations are now undoable</span> - 
		In previous releases, some application states operations (e.g., remove state) were
		not undoable. With Release 9, all state operations are undoable.
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Download commands now only download selected files</span> - 
		In previous releases, the Download command on the Files palette context menu and
		the "Download selected" icon on the Files palette toolbar would bring up the same
		dialog as the "Download Entire Project" icon. With Release 9,
		the context menu command and the "Download selected icon" only download the
		files that are currently selected.
	</li>
	<li><p><span class='majortopic'>Fixes for the experimental ZAZL option</span> - 
		Maqetta includes a feature where, using a preference, you can turn on the ZAZL
		option to cause certain operations (e.g., preview-in-browser) to use ZAZL
		technology to compile the runtime files before the preview operation happens.
		One of the fixes was to allow ZAZL to work with review/commenting. Note that
		ZAZL tends to make the first operation a little slower, but subsequent operations 
		sometimes speed up substantially.
	</li>
</ul>
